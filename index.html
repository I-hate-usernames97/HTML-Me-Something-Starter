   <p>I lived in a small town about an south of Seoul called Dongtan. I spent most of my weekdays exploring the small town finding cool places eat.</p>

         <h2>Gangneung:</h2>
         <img src="images/Gangneung.jpg" />
         <p>Gangneung is a beach town on the North East side of South Korea. We went there for a get-away weekend and it was the first time I set foot in the ocean or saw the ocean up close. There were lots of photo op stations along the beach and a lighthouse. It was pretty cold so we couldn't swim, but I waded into the water for as long as I could stand it.</p>

         <p>Suwon is the biggest nearby town to where we live. It has a World Heritage site called Suwon Fortress with a long wall. We took the bus to visit on a brisk spring day and spent the day exploring the site. The fortress surrounds a hill that overlooks the whole city and surrounding area and you can see our city from the top.</p>

         <p>Seoul is a massive metropolis and is the second biggest city I've ever visited. We oftten took the bus to visit different areas of the city, one being Myeongdong, which is a huge shopping district. We enjoyed lots of street food and people watching there!</p>

         <h2>Busan:</h2>
         <img src="images/Busan.jpg" />
         <p>We went to Busan on the last weekend that I was in Korea, which happened to be on my wife's birthday weekend. We stayed in a hostel with tiny bunkbeds close to the beach. We explored markets, ate ice cream, listened to a band that was busking in the street, and applied copious amounts of sunscreen while sitting on the beach. It was a great ending to my trip.</p>
